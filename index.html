              Mike Tyson, in full Michael Gerald Tyson, byname Iron Mike, (born
              June 30, 1966, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.), American boxer who, at
              age 20, became the youngest heavyweight champion in history. A
              member of various street gangs at an early age, Tyson was sent to
              reform school in upstate New York in 1978. At the reform school,
              social worker and boxing aficionado Bobby Stewart recognized his
              boxing potential and directed him to renowned trainer Cus D’Amato,
              who became his legal guardian. Tyson compiled a 24–3 record as an
              amateur and turned professional in 1985.

                Mike Tyson's final victory came in the form of a brutal knockout
                in 49 seconds against Clifford Etienne.

                'Iron Mike' was past his prime and had lost to Lennox Lewis the
                year prior but this fight still showed why he's one of the
                greats.
